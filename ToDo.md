# ToDo PanaxUI GUI - AngularJS

# Navigation

- Breadcrumb should work well with Nav tree
	- Should select navTree node and vice-verza
		- select_branch() should be in an routeChanged event?
		- https://github.com/ncuillery/angular-breadcrumb/wiki/API-Reference#state-options
			- parent
			- url params
	- Multi-level states resembling nav-tree?

- Routes should work for links (ex. http://localhost:3000/gui/ng/#/category/kitchen-sink)

- Pretty urls (sans #)
	- Scotch.io article?
